---Shelf-/
--------/

   Shelf is a functional, dynamic, stack-based language.


---Features-/
-----------/

   * Mostly pure functional. There's an impure print word
     and print-stack word, but that's about it. Functions
     are first class values.

   * Stack-based. All words (functions) take their
     parameters off the stack. Basically, all data resides
     on the stack.

   * Garbage Collected. Shelf is an interpreter written in
     OCaml, and as such, benefits from the underlying
     garbage collection.

   * Functional Interpreter. The interpreter is implemented
     using immutable data structures, so it's thread safe.

   * Arbitrary precision numbers. No need to worry about
     overflowing.


---Building-/
-----------/

   $ omake

   For more options, see INSTALL file.


---Examples-/
-----------/

   * Basic

      >>> "hello world" print
      "hello world"
      Stack:

      >>> 2 2 +
      Stack: 4

      >>> 3 2 -
      Stack: 1

   * Lists

      >>> [1 2 3 4 5] list
      Stack: (1,2,3,4,5)

      >>> [1 2 3 4] list head
      Stack: (2,3,4) 1

   * Anonymous functions

      >>> 1 2 [+] apply
      Stack: 3

      >>> 1 2 < ["logic makes sense"] ["alt universe"] if
      Stack: "logic makes sense"

   * Named functions

      >>> def fac { dup 0 = [pop 1] [dup 1 - fac *] if }
      Stack:
      >>> 5 fac
      Stack: 120
      >>> pop 39 fac
      Stack: 20397882081197443358640281739902897356800000000
